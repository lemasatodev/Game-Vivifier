--2.1.3--
- In case we fail to detect the NVCPL after running it, we will alert the user.
This is meants to prevent a rare issue where the NVCPL cannot be accessed, due to a corrupted drivers installation.
- In case flux is detected, a traytip will appear, to alert the user of a known conflict.
- Fix: When unable to reach github, an empty version could appear.
- Fix: The "Run on system startup" setting would not be saved locally.
- Fix: Hotkeys could fail to work as intended.

--2.1 & 2.1.1 & 2.1.2--
2.1.2: Fix: Language change in the Settings would not be saved through reloading.
2.1.1: Fix: The updater file would not be deleted after the update process.

Re-written from scratch, for a cleaner approach.
Most of these changes are code-wise, but here are the most important changes!:

Features:
- Hotkeys.
Gamma: Increase and Reduce.
Vibrance: Increase and Reduce.
Special: Trigger/Save.

The Gamma and Vibrance hotkeys allow you to control the currently active application's settings.
If the application does not have a profile (tray menu > Settings), these settings will be lost upon reload/close.

Pressing the Trigger/Save hotkey on an application that does not have a profile will automatically create one for it and save its settings.
This hotkey also allows you to force loading the current application's profile.

The same hotkey can be used for multiple actions.

- Tray notifications
The application now use custom tray notifications, allowing a better look.
In case a new version is available, it will be shown through a notification.

Changes:
- Removed the "Monitor ID" setting. 
The Monitor ID is now automatically retrieven, based on the application's window position.
- You can see the latest version and version specific changelogs from the "About?" tray menu.
